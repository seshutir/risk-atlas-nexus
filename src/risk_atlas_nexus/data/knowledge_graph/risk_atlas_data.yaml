    their capability to perform challenging tasks, potential to speed up the adoption
    of AI, ability to increase productivity and the cost benefits they provide. Discuss
    the three categories of risk, including risks known from earlier forms of AI,
    known risks amplified by foundation models and emerging risks intrinsic to the
    generative capabilities of foundation models. Cover the principles, pillars and
    governance that form the foundation of IBM’s AI ethics initiatives and suggest

  concern: Training and operating large AI models, building data centers, and manufacturing
    specialized hardware for AI can consume large amounts of water and energy, which
    contributes to carbon emissions. Additionally, water resources that are used for

  description: In AI-assisted decision-making tasks, reliance measures how much a
    person trusts (and potentially acts on) a model’s output. Over-reliance occurs
    when a person puts too much trust in a model, accepting a model’s output when
    the model’s output is likely incorrect. Under-reliance is the opposite, where
    the person doesn’t trust the model but should.

    access to these models results in students having a superficial understanding
    of concepts and hampers further education that might rely on understanding those
    concepts.

  tag: human-exploitation
  type: non-technical
  descriptor: amplified by generative AI
  concern: 'Foundation models still depend on human labor to source, manage, and program
    the data that is used to train the model. Human exploitation for these activities
    might negatively impact the society and human welfare. '
- id: atlas-toxic-output
  name: Toxic output
  description: Toxic output occurs when the model produces hateful, abusive, and profane
    (HAP) or obscene content. This also includes behaviors like bullying.

  descriptor: specific to generative AI
  concern: Hateful, abusive, and profane (HAP) or obscene content can adversely impact
    and harm people interacting with the model.

  description: 'Explanations, lineage and trace information, and source attribution
    for AI agent actions might be difficult, imprecise or unobtainable. '

  tag: unexplainable-untraceable-actions
  type: agentic
  descriptor: amplified by agentic AI
  concern: 'Without clear explanations, lineage trace information, and source attributions
    for AI agent actions, it is difficult for users, model validators, and auditors
    to understand and trust the model. Wrong explanations might lead to over-trust.'
- id: atlas-data-poisoning
  name: Data poisoning
  description: A type of adversarial attack where an adversary or malicious insider
    injects intentionally corrupted, false, misleading, or incorrect samples into
    the training or fine-tuning datasets.

  isDefinedByTaxonomy: ibm-risk-atlas
  isPartOf: ibm-risk-atlas-robustness
  tag: data-poisoning
  type: training-data
  descriptor: traditional risk of AI
  concern: Poisoning data can make the model sensitive to a malicious data pattern
    and produce the adversary’s desired output. It can create a security risk where
    adversaries can force model behavior for their own benefit.
- id: atlas-unreliable-source-attribution
  name: Unreliable source attribution
  description: Source attribution is the AI system's ability to describe from what
    training data it generated a portion or all its output. Since current techniques
    are based on approximations, these attributions might be incorrect.

  type: output
  descriptor: specific to generative AI
  concern: Low-quality attributions make it difficult for users, model validators,
    and auditors to understand and trust the model.
